  <h1>Hello! My name is Kevin and this is a little about me.</h1>
  <h2 class="box">
    I moved to Boise from Idaho Falls in 2012. My girlfriend and I have a 4 year old girl. I'm a fairly
    capable mechanic. I had a 91 Integra that I rebuilt/replaced practically everything inside of from the ground up.

  <h2>
    I've dabbled with coding a
    little bit, but I'm definitely no where near a professional level. I was refered to codeworks by a couple of friends
    that took this course. I'm hoping to open a new career field for me in all kinds of programming. Prior to this, I
    worked for Jimmy John's for about 5.5 years. I started as a driver and worked my way up management into a General
    Manager position to find out that I hated working 70 hours a week to get paid for only 50 of them.

  <h2>Some of my hobbies are:
    <ul>
      <li>Playing video games (especially League of Legends)</li>
      <li>Longboarding</li>
      <li>Running (I ran a 10k in about 47minutes last year)</li>
      <li>Playing guitar occasionally</li>
      <li>Hanging out with my family (obviously my favorite)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2> These are my pets
